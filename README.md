# Vertical Overview

## Description
Gnome has had vertically stacked workspaces for a long time. The Gnome 40 update unfortunately made the switch to a horizontal layout. A choice that many Gnome users disagree with. This extension Aims to replace the new Gnome overview with something that resembles the old style. 

## Installation:
You install it through ![Gnome Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4144/vertical-overview/).

Or you can install it manually:
```
git clone https://github.com/RensAlthuis/vertical-overview.git
cd vertical-overview
make
make install
```

If you use X11, reload the server (press `Alt-F2` and type `r`).
If you use Wayland, log out and log in.
You can detect your Windowing System in Settings → About.

Then enable the extension in "Extensions" application or via command:

```
gnome-extensions enable vertical-overview@RensAlthuis.github.com
```

## Donations
I never expected this to be something I have to consider. I really don't expect anyone to donate, nor do I want anyone to feel obligated to do so. I do this because I enjoy it and will for sure keeping working on it as long as I can. However multiple people have asked me to make a donation button, so here it is. If you are considering donating, Thank you so much! I really appreciate it.
